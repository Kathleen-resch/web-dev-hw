# Assignment 8
## Kathleen Resch
1. Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?

Leanring Html was an interesting experience. I didn't know anything about it before I started it. I found difficulty wth the integrating media. I also feel like I didn't really understand forms that much and figuring them out was very difficult. I thought that the media assignment was very interesting after having a few snags in the beginning I understood it. 

2. Next Topic we begin CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?

I am interested in making the layout of my websites better because that is one thing that bothers me is how I feel like I can't organize things in the way I want because I don't know how.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment

First I looked at the assignment and organized the requirements to which page I wanted to put them on. Then I made the head and body and div elements for each page. For this assignment I made my index.html first and wrote that out and worked on making the intructions and putting in all of the images. Then I moved on to the contact page and wrote in the forms and tables. Then I worked of the about.html because I figure that would be the easiest.
