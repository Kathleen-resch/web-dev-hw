# Assignment 6
## Kathleen Resch
Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do the serve?
I coem across forms everyday when I need to log into a website like moodle or I need to search something on Google. These forms help get me to my account on a website like Moodle or help direct me to the information I need. Forms help relay information in a easy way for the viewer

List examples of a text, selection, and button input, and where they might be used.
An example of a text is a password, this helps to encrypt information and hide it from the outside. Passwords are used when trying to log into an account like an email. An example of a selection is a check box, this allows you to pick multiple options out of a list. Selections help to provide a limited option of answers and pick one or more. Selections  Buttons help with interactivity and submit buttons send the information and move the user to the next page on the site.  

Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment. 
For this assignment I went through the moodle assignment and the walkthrough and worked to place all of the requirements in the .html file. I tried to do all of the things I knew how to do first like create the heading and the address section. Then I went through the website and the textbook to figure out the rest of the form. I made sure to have it open in a seperate tab and refreshed whenever I made something new.
