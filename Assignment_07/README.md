# Assigment 7: Media
## Kathleen Resch
1. Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.
 
Divs are the building blocks of the page. They section out information and help keep things organized. Classes group similar elements together using the same name. Elements can have more than one class. Ids provide unique information about each element on the page. Each Id is unique to what is being identified. Spans create organize and style information within divs. Spans are kind of like a div within a div. 

2. What is "alt text," and why do we use it?

Alt Text is a description of the image that always needs to be added when embedding a picture. It is important if the photo cannot be seen or the person using the page is visually impaired.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

For this assignment I started by building the framework of my index.html. I made sure to add all of the basic body and style elements. Then I created all of my folders for this assignment and downloaded the media arts package. Then I created all 5 of my divs at once so I could be able to make sure they were all the same. Then I added the headings and choose heading 2 for all of them. Then I went through each div and I chose to do the divs I felt the most comfortable with first which were the lyrics and Album Art sections. Then I worked on the Media arts video and the youtube video embedding at the same time as I went through the section on videos. Then I added the google Map for the location of campus. I struggled with the audio section because for some reason SoundCloud on the chrome browser does not have a share option. I ended up having to have my roomate open it on safari and email the embedded code to me. Other than the hiccup with SoundCloud, everything went relatively smooth.
