1. Briefly share your design process for this assignment. What fonts did you choose, and why?

I really like serif fonts so I wanted to use one for the body.I felt that the headings should be in a sans-serif font. The font I used for the title was my first choice for the body but I didn't like how it looked. I wanted two fonts that I felt complimented each other and they were pleasing to the eye.

2. What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font? What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?

System fonts are fonts within the processing system of a certain computer, these fonts often aren't suitable for the web because they can't transfer over properly. A web font is a font that is hosted on a server, they don't have to be up on a certain processor to appear. Web-safe fonts are fonts that appear on most processors so are especially good for the web because they will load faster

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

I made my html file and tried to make sure all of the content of the page was correct before moving to my style.css. As I made my style.css I made sure to pick my fonts first and make my fonts.css. As i worked on the style I made sure to add all of the required element and I made sure i could read the exerpt well. I made sure that I was easily able to read the page and that is was fine to read
