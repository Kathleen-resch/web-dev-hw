# Assignment 5
## Kathleen Resch
1. How many document <head> and <body> elements can a page have? How are these elements different, or what role do they play?
    
    A page can  have as many head and body elements as needed. There are 5 main head elements. Head elements are not visible on the page and are only read by the browser, this information can include the language, the name of the website, the author, and search tags. Body elements are what shows up on the actual page and is seen by the visitor. The body elements determine what information is seen on the page and how it is presented.
    
2. Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup.
   
   Stuctural markup determines how the body is organized. Structural elements include headings, paragraphs, and lists. Semantic markup is used to reinforce meaning within a document and make visual emphasis. Semantic markup include bold, italics, and underline.
    
3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
   
   For this assignment I worked on my index.html first. I went through the information on the Web-dev website and compared that to the assignment on moodle and went through and edited the html file. I wanted to make sure the head was correct first before I moved onto the body. While working on the body I made sure that I had the website up at the same time in order to make sure it looked correct to me. I kept the assignment instructions in a html comment so it would not interfere with how my work looked.
