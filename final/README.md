## Final
1. Did you learn anything new about web development (ie using GitHub, version control, repositories)?

I knew nothing about web development before beginning this class. I learned how to use GitHub and text editors. 

2. Did you learn anything new about web design (ie using media, color, fonts)?

I didn't know anything about Web development when beginning this class and so everything was new to me. I learned how to use HTML and inserting media was very cool. 

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

I started by creating my documents. I decided to add all of the elements I wanted to add first from former projects. Then I added the information I wanted to add about myself. I wasn't sure what to make my site about so I amde it a site about myself and my works.
