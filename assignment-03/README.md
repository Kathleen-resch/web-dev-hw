1. Very briefly detail how browsers function. List any browsers you currently use to surf - or even develop for - the web.

Browsers work to access the internet and help read the code sent to the computer. The browser renders the webpage and constructs the page. The browser helps to link the User interface to the network and rendering engine. Browsers also have local storage for information. I use Google Chrome for all of my browsing on my computer and Safari to browse the internet on my phone.

2. What is a markup language? Describe one commonly used in development.
A markup Language dictates what is seen on the page and deals primarily with the text and the format of the page. One commonly used markup language is HTML. HTML is the most widely used markup language, it can be used to render content and page structure. It also has a standardized element and marking system.
