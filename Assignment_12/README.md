## Assignment 12

1. Who was your imaginary client? How did they describe their site needs?

My imaginary buisness is "Marty's Muffins" a bakery that focuses on muffins and other breakfast items for on the go. I imagined that they are a cafe that wanted to expand to a small catering and wanted to grow their online presense. I wanted to make a user friendly site where they could easily access the main elements in order to find what they needed. 

2. What is the difference between display: block, display: inline, and display: inline-block?

Block puts things in a vertical line, inline- block puts elements in a horizontal line but seperaated, and inline puts elements in a horizontal line.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

The first thing I did after making all of my html documents was create the nav bar because I wanted to get the hardest part out of the way first. Then I added all of the text and other elements to the pages. i created the form on the contact.html last. Then I used the style.css to style my pages.
