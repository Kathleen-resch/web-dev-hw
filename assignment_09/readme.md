1. Briefly describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?

A universal selector selects everything on the page and formats all of it. This works weel with fonts and background colors. An element slector selects everything of the same type, like it can select all headings or all paragraphs. This helps with formatting and making a theme. Class selectors select everything with the same class. This can help group things with similar content types. An ID selector selects one specific element on a page. This helps if you want to add emphasis.

2. Describe your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, rgb values, or hex codes

My color palette was made up of magenta (F46B62), hot pink(FF7BF9), and light blue(54A1FF). I also included yellow(F8FF8C) and dark blue(190AFF) for the background.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

I started by making all of the files and folders for this assignment. Then I added all of the base elements to my index.html. The next thing I did was make my html without styling and wrote out all of my content. Then I worked on my style.css and worked to make the page look like I wanted too. I made sure to add all of the proper elements while I was playing around with the colors and positionings.
