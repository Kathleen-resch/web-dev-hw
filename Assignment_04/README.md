1. Visit a site using The Wayback Machine, looking at a snapshot at least 10 years old. Where did you go? What did it look like? How has it changed?

I went to Twitter.com on the Wayback machine. It was not as cleanly organized as it is now and had a lot less of the features. The layout was more difficult to navigate and it was harder to look at individual profiles. Another interesting thing is that most people were tweeting from a computer and not their phone. Now the layout of twitter is much more user friendly and it is easier to post media alongside tweets.

2. Summarize your experience with the GIT Module. What did you learn? What was difficult, easy, or still misunderstood?

I couldn't download the GIT Module due to my computer being unable to run that type of program. I am doing everything locally on my computer and uploading it myself. I think I am getting the hang of it.

3. Include your screenshot as an image [link](/images/screenshot.png)
