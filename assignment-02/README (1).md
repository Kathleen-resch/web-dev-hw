# Assignment 2
## Kathleen Resch
I decided to take this class because I wanted to learn a new skill and since I spend a lot of time on the internet doing class work and studying I figured it would be interesting to learn more about it. I'm also graduating soon and I figured it would be nice to learn something that could make me stand out in the job market, and I figured Web Development would be a good choice.

1. I've learned how the internet travels across the ocean.
2. I've learned there is more to a URL than a random string of letters and numbers
3. I hope to learn how to make an engaging website that would make someone want to look around and learn more.


- A link to any website you visit frequently using its [absolute URL](http://my.umt.edu/students)

- A link to your responses.txt file using its [relative URL](./responses.txt)
- An image link to your screenshot using its [relative URL](./images/Screenshot_assignment_2.png)
