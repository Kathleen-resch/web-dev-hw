3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment. 

First I made my HTMl and my CSS. Then I chose the art work I wanted to use which was "In" by Roy Lictenstien. I really liked the bright colors and the shape of the letters. I then decided to just recreate the I because I felt like that would be easier than recreating the I and N. Then I formatted my HTML that would allow for the three boxes. Then I worked on styling and making sure it was formatted properly to my liking. Then I added the color and the description for the image.
