        <h1>Why I chose the topic I chose </h1>
        <p>I chose to make my instructable on tuning a ukelele because I have recently started learning to play the ukelele. Learning to tune it was one of the first things I had to learn how to do. You need a tuned ukelele in order properly play it. I have been learning to ply the ukelele because I have always loved music and playing the ukelele has become a new hobby of mine. It's a big stress reliever for me. 
            <hr/> If you want to learn more I was inspired by the <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Tune-a-Ukulele">wiki-how article</a> about this subject as well as a variety of videos on Youtube.</p>
